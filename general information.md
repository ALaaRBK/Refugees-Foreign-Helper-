   // some information about md5: md5 is A cryptographic hash function is a fully defined, deterministic function which uses no secret key.
   // It takes as input a message of arbitrary length (a stream of bits, any bits) and produces a fixed-size output. (since the function can accept many more distinct inputs than it can produce distinct outputs), but we require that it is unfeasible to find even one collision -->.
